The Coterminous Conflux Framework is designed to be fast deployment MVC framework with power and versatility, yet enforce quality web standards and coding best practices.

Benefits:

 * Completely separates business logic (controller) from display logic (view)
 * All output is rendered without using output buffering
 * Stongly cased URLs, with URL hint redirection
 * Complete database abstraction for all CRUD operations through the Model interface
 * Uses Database introspection for non-defined model types
